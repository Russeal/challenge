# Challenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Log in credentials

{
  username: "abish",
  password: "1234"
},
{
  username: "merlyn",
  password: "merlyn"
},
{
  username: "kilian",
  password: "7"
},
{
  username: "adam",
  password: "adam19",
},

## Moreover

If you click on the name of logged in person at top right corner, there is a dropdown for log out.
I made the posts page with pagination, because there were 100 posts. On each page click the app gets 10 posts.
